Some were simple, while others took a bit to puzzle out. I can honestly say I don't remember any prizes. The journey on the way was the real adventure.

That is the inspiration for my Treasure Hunts. I want to bring joy to others while experiencing joy myself. I trust your experience is everything you hoped it would be, and then some.

These treasure hunts have been a long time coming. My first iteration of them began in December of 2018. I was close to launching that version the following March but then the world came to a standstill. To be honest, it wasnâ€™t the best version of Riddle the City. RTC has taken a lot of twists and turns to get to where it is today. It will change more as we make our way into the future. This version was launched in the Fall of 2024. We will adapt to whatever the world throws at us.</p>
